# üîê Arcium Testnet Access Application

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Project:** ShadowVault Protocol  
**Purpose:** Cypherpunk Hackathon Submission

## üìß EMAIL TO ARCIUM TEAM

**To:** arihant@arcium.com, support@arcium.com  
**Subject:** Testnet Access Request - ShadowVault Protocol (Cypherpunk Hackathon)

---

**Email Body:**

```
Hi Arcium Team,

I'm building ShadowVault Protocol for your <encrypted> Side Track in the 
Cypherpunk Hackathon, and I need testnet access to complete the integration.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
ShadowVault is a privacy-preserving institutional DeFi aggregator on Solana 
that uses Arcium MPC for encrypted trade intent routing.

CURRENT STATUS:
‚úÖ Complete MPC client architecture designed
‚úÖ Smart contract deployed on Solana Devnet
‚úÖ Full system architecture documented
‚è≥ Need testnet access for live integration

WHAT I'VE BUILT:
- GitHub: https://github.com/kikiprojecto/shadowvault-protocol
- Contract: HKFDPxSMDTcMjNWnDR3u4YH5VKcxTKieV9snBY5HumBe (Solana Devnet)
- Architecture: Complete MPC integration design ready

WHAT I NEED:
- Arcium testnet API endpoint
- API credentials/keys
- SDK documentation (if available)
- Integration examples

TIMELINE:
- Hackathon deadline: 19 days
- Integration timeline: 2-3 days with access
- Testing & polish: 1 week

USE CASE:
Privacy-preserving trade execution for institutional traders:
1. Client encrypts trade intent (token pair, amount, strategy)
2. Arcium MPC computes optimal DEX routing privately
3. Zero-knowledge proof generated for on-chain verification
4. Trade executes on Solana without revealing strategy

This demonstrates a novel application of encrypted compute for 
institutional DeFi adoption ($100B+ market opportunity).

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Language: TypeScript (client), Rust (smart contract)
- Integration: lib/arcium/mpc-client.ts (ready for SDK)
- Encryption: AES-256-GCM with ephemeral keys
- MPC Pattern: 3 nodes, 2-of-3 threshold

I'm ready to integrate immediately upon receiving access. The architecture 
is complete and production-ready.

Can you please grant testnet access for this hackathon project?

Best regards,
kikiprojecto
