## 🎬 **DEMO VIDEO OUTLINE** (2-3 minutes)

### **0:00-0:30 - Introduction**
> "Hi! I'm [Name] and I built ShadowVault Protocol for the Arcium x Superteam hackathon. ShadowVault solves a critical problem: how can traders execute strategies privately on public blockchains?"

### **0:30-1:00 - Problem & Solution**
> "Currently, all transactions are visible on-chain, leading to MEV exploitation and strategy copying. ShadowVault uses Arcium's encrypted compute to enable private trade execution while maintaining verifiability."

### **1:00-1:30 - Landing Page Demo**
> [Show browser on Edge]
> "Here's our production-ready landing page. Notice the beautiful gradient background, floating particles, and clear value proposition. We have three key features: encrypted execution, MEV protection, and Solana speed."

### **1:30-2:00 - Arcium Integration**
> "Here's how Arcium powers the privacy: Users submit encrypted trade intents, Arcium's MPC network computes optimal routing in a Trusted Execution Environment, and execution happens without revealing strategies. Only a 32-byte hash is stored on-chain."

### **2:00-2:30 - Live Deployment**
> [Click "View on Explorer"]
> "The smart contract is live on Solana Devnet. Here's the program ID, and you can see it's deployed and verified. This is a fully functional protocol ready for institutional adoption."

### **2:30-3:00 - Impact & Closing**
> "ShadowVault enables $100B+ in institutional capital to enter Solana DeFi by providing privacy that meets professional standards. This is just the beginning of confidential DeFi on Solana. Thank you!"
