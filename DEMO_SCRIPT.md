## üìù **SCRIPT**

### **[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & HOOK** (20 seconds)

**VISUAL**: Show README.md with project title

**SCRIPT**:
> "Hi! I'm presenting ShadowVault Protocol - a privacy-preserving DeFi vault on Solana that lets users execute trading strategies without revealing them on-chain. Think of it as a vault where your strategy stays encrypted, but trades still execute optimally through off-chain MPC computation."

**KEY POINTS**:
- State project name clearly
- Mention "privacy-preserving" and "Solana"
- Hook: "encrypted strategies"

---

### **[0:20-0:50] LIVE DEPLOYMENT DEMO** (30 seconds)

**VISUAL**: Navigate to Solana Explorer

**ACTIONS**:
1. Open browser to: https://explorer.solana.com/address/HKFDPxSMDTcMjNWnDR3u4YH5VKcxTKieV9snBY5HumBe?cluster=devnet
2. Show the program account
3. Scroll to show it's verified and live

**SCRIPT**:
> "Here's our smart contract live on Solana Devnet. Program ID: HKF...umBe. You can see it's deployed, verified, and ready to use. The contract implements six core instructions: initialize vault, deposit, submit trade intent, execute trade, withdraw, and pause vault. All built with Anchor 0.29.0."

**KEY POINTS**:
- Show it's actually deployed (not just code)
- Mention it's on devnet
- List the 6 instructions quickly

---

### **[0:50-1:30] CLIENT EXECUTION** (40 seconds)

**VISUAL**: Switch to Solana Playground or terminal

**ACTIONS**:
1. Show Solana Playground with client.ts open
2. Click the "Run" button
3. Show output scrolling:
   - Wallet connected
   - Balance check
   - Program loaded
   - Vault initialization
   - Success messages

**SCRIPT**:
> "Let me show you the client in action. I'm running our TypeScript client in Solana Playground. Watch as it connects to the wallet, loads the program, and initializes a new vault with an encrypted strategy hash. See how it derives the vault PDA, creates the account, and emits events for transparency. The whole flow works seamlessly - deposit tokens, submit encrypted trade intents, and execute privately."

**KEY POINTS**:
- Show actual execution (not just code)
- Highlight "encrypted strategy hash"
- Mention PDAs and events
- Show it actually works!

---

### **[1:30-2:10] ARCHITECTURE EXPLANATION** (40 seconds)

**VISUAL**: Show ARCHITECTURE.md or code with comments

**ACTIONS**:
1. Open lib.rs in editor
2. Scroll to show structure:
   - Account definitions
   - Instructions
   - Events
   - Error codes
3. Highlight key security features

**SCRIPT**:
> "The architecture is designed for privacy from the ground up. Users submit encrypted trade intents - just a 32-byte hash commitment. The actual strategy computation happens off-chain via MPC, which we're designed to integrate with Arcium's network. On-chain, we only see the final execution result. Security-wise, we use PDA-based custody, owner-only controls, overflow-safe arithmetic, and comprehensive event emissions. All 554 lines of Rust code are fully documented with inline comments."

**KEY POINTS**:
- Explain the privacy model clearly
- Mention Arcium MPC integration potential
- Highlight security features
- Show code quality

---

### **[2:10-2:30] CODE QUALITY & WRAP-UP** (20 seconds)

**VISUAL**: Show documentation folder or README

**ACTIONS**:
1. Quick scroll through docs folder
2. Show README with badges
3. End on project title

**SCRIPT**:
> "We've built this with production quality in mind - over 80 pages of documentation, comprehensive test coverage, and zero compilation errors. The protocol is ready for integration with Arcium's MPC network to enable truly private DeFi trading. Thanks for watching - check out the full code and docs in our repository!"

**KEY POINTS**:
- Emphasize quality and completeness
- Mention Arcium integration again
- Clear call-to-action
