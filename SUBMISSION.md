## 📋 Project Information

**Project Name:** ShadowVault Protocol  
**Tagline:** Privacy-First Institutional DeFi Aggregator on Solana  
**Team:** kikiprojecto  
**Repository:** https://github.com/kikiprojecto/shadowvault-protocol

## 🎯 One-Sentence Pitch

ShadowVault enables institutional traders to execute large trades on Solana with complete privacy using Arcium's MPC network to encrypt trade intents, compute optimal routing off-chain, and settle on-chain without revealing strategies.

---

## 🔐 Arcium Integration

### How We Use Arcium's Encrypted Compute

**1. Client-Side Encryption**
```typescript
// User's trade intent encrypted before submission
const encryptedIntent = await arciumClient.encryptTradeIntent({
  tokenIn: "SOL",
  tokenOut: "USDC",
  amount: 1000000000,
  maxSlippage: 50,
  strategy: "TWAP"
});
```

**2. MPC Network Processing**
- Encrypted intent sent to Arcium MPC network
- 3-party computation with 2-of-3 threshold
- Optimal routing computed privately across Jupiter, Raydium, Orca
- Zero-knowledge proof generated

**3. On-Chain Execution**
```rust
// Smart contract verifies MPC proof and executes
pub fn handler(
    ctx: Context<ExecuteTrade>,
    encrypted_params: [u8; 32],
    mpc_proof: [u8; 64],
    computation_id: [u8; 32],
) -> Result<()> {
    require!(verify_mpc_proof(&encrypted_params, &mpc_proof));
    // Execute trade with privacy preserved
}
```

### Integration Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ Complete MPC client architecture (`lib/arcium/mpc-client.ts`)
- ✅ Smart contract with proof verification
- ✅ Encryption/decryption flow using Web Crypto API
- ✅ Production-ready code structure
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

**Pending:**
- ⏳ Arcium testnet access (closed beta)
- ⏳ Live MPC network integration

**Why This Matters:**
- Architecture demonstrates deep understanding of MPC concepts
- Code is production-ready for immediate integration
- Clear path from hackathon MVP to production deployment

## 💡 Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Institutional traders lose **2-8% of trade value** to:
- MEV extraction and front-running
- Strategy copying by competitors
- Information leakage on public blockchain
- **Result:** $3T institutional capital stays away from DeFi

### Our Solution
**Privacy-preserving trade execution:**
- 🔒 Trade intents encrypted via Arcium MPC
- 🔐 Routing computed off-chain without data exposure
- ⚡ Fast settlement on Solana
- 🛡️ Complete strategy confidentiality

**Market Impact:** Unlocks $100B+ institutional capital for DeFi

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract (Rust/Anchor)
- **Framework:** Anchor 0.29.0
- **Instructions:** 6 core operations
  - `initialize` - Create vault
  - `deposit` - Add liquidity
  - `submit_trade_intent` - Submit encrypted intent
  - `execute_trade` - Execute with MPC proof
  - `withdraw` - Remove liquidity (owner only)
  - `pause_vault` - Emergency controls

### Frontend (TypeScript/Next.js)
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Design:** Professional glassmorphism UI
- **Features:** Responsive, animated, production-ready

### Arcium Integration
- **Client:** `lib/arcium/mpc-client.ts`
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with ephemeral keys
- **Proof System:** Zero-knowledge proof verification
- **Documentation:** Complete technical specs

## 💪 Competitive Advantages

**vs. Traditional DEX Aggregators:**
- ✅ Privacy-preserving (they expose all data)
- ✅ MEV protection (they're vulnerable)
- ✅ Strategy confidentiality (they leak patterns)

**vs. Dark Pools:**
- ✅ Decentralized (they're centralized)
- ✅ Transparent settlement (they lack auditability)
- ✅ Lower fees (they charge premium)

**vs. Other Privacy Solutions:**
- ✅ Solana speed (others are slow)
- ✅ Arcium MPC (others use less secure methods)
- ✅ Production-ready (others are theoretical)
